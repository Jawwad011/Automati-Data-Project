# Automati-Data-Project
Welcome to the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) project in Python. This initiative, powered by Automatidata, aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis, translate data into insights, apply statistical methods, simplify complex data relationships, and implement machine learning to enhance taxi service efficiency.
# Key Objectives

# 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Conduct thorough EDA to understand and visualize patterns in TLC data.
# 2. Translate Data into Insights: 
Derive actionable insights from the vast dataset to inform decision-making.
# 3. Statistics: 
Apply statistical methods to validate assumptions and draw meaningful conclusions.
# 4. Simplify Complex Data Relationships: 
Employ techniques to simplify complex data relationships for better interpretability.
# 5. Machine Learning: 
Develop a regression model for estimating taxi fares pre-ride, optimizing efficiency.
# Python Components
# 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Scripts:
Python scripts for in-depth exploration of TLC dataset.
# 2. Insight Translation Code:
Python code translating data insights into actionable recommendations.
# 3. Statistical Analysis:
Utilize Python statistical libraries for robust data validation.
# 4. Data Relationship Simplification:
Implement techniques to simplify and visualize complex data relationships.
# 5. Machine Learning Model:
Develop and implement a regression model for fare estimation.
# Recommendations
Leverage the derived insights to inform TLC decision-making, optimize service efficiency, and enhance the overall taxi experience in New York City.
